# AdventOfCode


This is a repo holding my solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) 2015 puzzles. 

I decided it might be nice to learn a bit while doing this so I will be doing the puzzles in a couple different languages.
Current List:
* Python 
* Ruby 
* Haskell

Days Complete:
* [~~1~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsacUAM8Q1w)
* ~~2~~

I will also be uploading a video of me completing my first try (blind) of the puzzle for that day.
